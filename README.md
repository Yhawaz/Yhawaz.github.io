## Intro

 Hello! I'm a third year undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm interested in working across the hardware-software stack, digital system design, and all things low level.

 Here's my [resume](photos/resume.pdf), and feel free to reach me at [yhawaz AT mit DOT edu]. 

 I'm currently working on developing network on chip for hardware accelerators targetting sparse linear algebra under Prof. Daniel Sanchez. Outside of making hardware run fast or making really ugly breadboards in lab, I really enjoy playing music I play bass for MIT's Jazz Combos, DJ, and love making weird sounds in abelton.

## Projects
### HoloForge: a camera-controlled 3D model viewer on FPGA
*Final Project for 6.205(6.111): Digital Systems Laboratory*

In this class, assignments were completed in SystemVerilog and deployed to Xilinx FPGAs.
<!-- sample assingments if you wanna do that -->
The class concluded with a open-ended final project, and my parter and I decided to create a camera-controlled 3D Model viewer that could render 3D-meshes, and change the view of the scene based on real-time camera inputs. We also decided to utilize the offboard DDR3 ram for our framebuffer to allow for better resoultion down the line.

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~


## Blockquotes


> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.


## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

## Tables

| ------ | ----------- |
