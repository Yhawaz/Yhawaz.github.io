            Senior in EECS at MIT. Kind of like a cat.<br>

            <h2>starters</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a Senior at MIT studying EECS. I currently really enjoy working in the Computer Architecture and FPGA space. I've been getting into hardware centered performance engineering in Cuda, and FPGA's for use in the Radio space I think a lot of this work is really interesting.

            <h2>research/experience</h2>
            <p>I’ve spent the last ~2.5 years of my life doing research with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/sanchez/">Prof. Daniel Sanchez</a>  on lightweight Network on Chips for hardware accelerators targeting sparse matrices/irregular workloads.</p>

            <p>I also spent last summer interning at <a href="https://www.zerorisc.com/"> zeroRisc</a> , a startup working on developing and helping users integrate Opentitan, the first open-source silicon root of trust. I did a lot of the work/development on starting to introduce an AXI IP for opentitan. You can read the <a href="https://www.zerorisc.com/blog/bridging-hardware-and-software-summer-intern-project"> blog</a> I wrote while I was there to learn more.</p>

            <h2>projects</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>JazzyDude: A PSOC-Based digital synth</strong>
                        <p> For my MicroComputer class final project I made a saxophone synth/digital instrument, implemented ADSR, and made it so it could playback jazz standards, all on a PSOC 5LP. Click to learn more :p</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="projects/holoforge.html"><b>Holoforge: A FPGA 3D Model Viewer</b></a>
                        <p>  For my undergrad digital systems class me and my proj partner made a FPGA 3D model viewer that took in camera inputs and rotated/changed the rendering of a 3D model based on them. I had to do some weird AXI Dram stuff, a cool learning experience. Click to learn more :p</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Cache Me Outside: A SuperScalar Processor</b>
                        <p> For my advanced architecture class, me and 2 dudes made a SuperScalar processor in BlueSpec, that was about it. It was cool click to learn more.</p>
                </li>

                </ul>
            <h2>education/teaching</h2>
                <p> I’m a Senior in EECS at MIT. I will (95% sure) be returning next year to get my M.ENG in EECS with a concentration in Computer Architecture. You can see the classes I took in order of how cool I think they were here.</p>
                <p> I’ve also taught a good bit in my time at MIT, I’ve been a Lab Assistant hosting office hours, and helping students debug their work in : </p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    6.205: My school’s FPGA/Digital Systems lab Course
                </li>
                <li>
                    6.1910: My school’s Computer Architecture Course
                </li>
                <li>
                    6.1010: my school’s Python Course
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I really enjoy teaching, I hate it when people have weird bugs, but I love getting to basically rant to someone about hardware, and getting PAYED for it.</p>
            <h2>personal</h2>
            <p>outside of all this nerd stuff I also enjoy a few things outside of what happens in my computer or whatever board im probbing</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I really enjoy playing Jazz/funk bass, I’m part of a Jazz Combo and it's awesome. I also just love listening to Jazz, as a hardware engineer I feel like most experience and emotions can be summarized by 3 bill evans songs. I deeply enjoy Bill Evans. 
                </li>
                <li>
                MMA/Kickboxing, I love fighting its so much fun and such a pure form of self expression
                </li>
                <li>
                
                ricing my macos, I don’t do much but I do spend a lot of fun time tinkering with my hw/sw setup as opposed to raw dogging vs code. Definitely not a purist as I use lazyvim, but I’m trying to fix that.
                 </li>
                <li>
                reading manga, I deeply enjoy Blue Period and Red Blue, their some of my favorite pieces of media by far
                 </li>
                 </li>
                <li>
                dJing/electronic dance music, I really enjoy mixing  EDM/UKG/jersey club songs, i have mixes, maybe they’re linked here, maybe they’re not
                 </li>
            </ul> 
            <h2>cats</h2>
            <p>I do not currently own any cats, this section is for when I eventually adopt one. I would like the record to show that I love cats.</p>
